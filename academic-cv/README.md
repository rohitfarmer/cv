LaTeX template for a long academic CV.

Dependency: [texlive (linux)](https://tug.org/texlive/)  

To compile the .tex file run `make`. It will produce a .pdf file.

One of the main features that I find interesting in this template is that it can do reverse serial numbering in the publication list.
